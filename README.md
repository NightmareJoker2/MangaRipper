MangaRipper
===

This is a fork of the project at https://mangaripper.codeplex.com/ by [Nguyen Dan Phuong](https://www.codeplex.com/site/users/view/NguyenDanPhuong "CodePlex - NguyenDanPhuong") licensed under MS-PL. I have just been toying around with it for a bit.
Not to be confused with the other fork at https://mangaripper2.codeplex.com/
